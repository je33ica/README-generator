// Installation
// Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible.
//  If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version
//  or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

//  Usage
// Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can.
// It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate,
//  while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

// Support
// Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.
// //  explain and showcase what your application does,
// //  justify the technologies used
// //   challenges you faced
// //   features you hope to implement in the future

// //  how to install
